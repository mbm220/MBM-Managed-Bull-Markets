## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Managed Bull Markets (MBM), we take security seriously and appreciate the help of the community in identifying potential vulnerabilities in our platform. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it promptly and responsibly. 

### How to Report a Vulnerability

   - A brief description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
   - Any potential impact or risks associated with the vulnerability.

2. **Confidentiality**: We request that you refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had the opportunity to investigate and address the issue. This helps ensure that our users are not at risk while we work on a resolution.

### What to Expect After Reporting

### Vulnerability Acceptance or Decline

- **Accepted Vulnerability**: If your report is accepted as a valid vulnerability, we will work to remediate the issue as quickly as possible. You may receive further communication from our team regarding the timeline for a fix and any required follow-up actions.

- **Declined Vulnerability**: If your report does not meet our criteria for a valid vulnerability, we will notify you of our decision and provide an explanation.
